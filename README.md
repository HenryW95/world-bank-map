# world-bank-map
Interactive Leaflet map that allows the user to view any country's World Bank data in a new tab.

Each feature in the geojson file has an attribute named "wb" that is appended to the end of the url "http://data.worldbank.org/country/". New maps could easily be created with this framework by editing the geojson file.
